# terraform-aws-cloudtrail [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail/releases) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision an AWS [CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/).

The module accepts an encrypted S3 bucket with versioning to store CloudTrail logs.

The bucket could be from the same AWS account or from a different account.

This is useful if an organization uses a number of separate AWS accounts to isolate the Audit environment from other environments (production, staging, development).

In this case, you create CloudTrail in the production environment (production AWS account),
while the S3 bucket to store the CloudTrail logs is created in the Audit AWS account, restricting access to the logs only to the users/groups from the Audit account.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail/releases).


```hcl
module "cloudtrail" {
  source                        = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail.git?ref=master"
  namespace                     = "eg"
  stage                         = "dev"
  name                          = "cluster"
  enable_log_file_validation    = true
  include_global_service_events = true
  is_multi_region_trail         = false
  enable_logging                = true
  s3_bucket_name                = "my-cloudtrail-logs-bucket"
}
```

__NOTE:__ To create an S3 bucket for CloudTrail logs, use [terraform-aws-cloudtrail-s3-bucket](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-s3-bucket) module.
It creates an S3 bucket and an IAM policy to allow CloudTrail logs.


```hcl
module "cloudtrail" {
  source                        = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail.git?ref=master"
  namespace                     = "eg"
  stage                         = "dev"
  name                          = "cluster"
  enable_log_file_validation    = true
  include_global_service_events = true
  is_multi_region_trail         = false
  enable_logging                = true
  s3_bucket_name                = module.cloudtrail_s3_bucket.bucket_id
}

module "cloudtrail_s3_bucket" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-s3-bucket.git?ref=master"
  namespace = "eg"
  stage     = "dev"
  name      = "cluster"
  region    = "us-east-1"
}
```
